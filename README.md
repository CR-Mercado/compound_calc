# compound_calc
 Small app to showcase Benefits of Compounding at High Interest Rates. Application is available at my [shinyapps.io](https://carlosmercado.shinyapps.io/compound_calc/), NOTE: on the free tier I only get 5 hours / month of public usage.
 
 # Premise 
 
 [Adamant Finance](http://adamant.finance/) is a Polygon based yield compounding service for Polygon Liquidity Pools. In discussion with a friend, I pointed out that at high interest rates, compounding multiple times a day generates noticeable marginal benefit compared to compounding monthly, quarterly, or annually. The decentralized finance space is highly volatile and extremely high interest rates are not unheard of. Generally, they are unsustainable because they are "juiced" with newly minted tokens with highly volatile values themselves. So even seeing 1,000% APR should not surprise users, as there is no guarantee that this APR covers the volatility of the coin (relative to USD). BUT, because those interest rates are so high, the opportunity to squeeze value via compounding of returns becomes a significant value-add. This is not financial advice, just an informational comment on a new, chaotic area of decentralized finance. 
 
 # Application 
 
 The application has 2 outputs. 
 
 1. A reactive * interactive plotly that allows for manipulating the initial value, and the interest rate to see the marginal difference in gains across compounding at 6 frequencies: annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, and continuously. Essentially, people compound about monthly or quarterly, and Adamant finance attempts to pool together costs to compound more frequently to generate value. Playing with the interest rate and initial values shows this exponential relationship between higher interest and higher compounding

2. Keeping the initial value fixed at $1,000; the second interactive plotly shows the differences in compounding across the 0.1% -> 300% interest rate range.

# Reminder 

This is not financial advice. Although I am degenerate and invest in extremely speculative decentralized finance instruments, I have done so gradually after 100s of hours of study into the economics of the space and ONLY with funds I am willing to lose. Please do not take this as an endorsement of Adamant Finance or any other speculative crypto opportunity. In fact, I'll even add in that Adamant Finance is itself a derivative of another protocol on the Binance Smart Chain that suffered a 96% loss after a $200M exploit. So, again, informational purposes only.
